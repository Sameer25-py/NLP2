    "##### `Learning Outcomes:`\n",
    "This notebook will teach you: how sklearn was efficiently implementing tfidf, importance of sparse matrices, some linear algebra, langauge modeling using n-grams, and how cosine similarity can do wonders. We hope you appreciate how simple these ideas are at their core. In fact, `Most great ideas are simple at their core`- [an](https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1221493526703366146) amazing quote by your TAs.    \n",

    "In this problem you will develop a technique for analyzing free text documents: a bag of words approach based on a TFIDF matrix. Here, you'll learn how did sklearn compute TFIDF for you in the other notebook in which you played with tweets. In other words, you'll implement TFIDF without using sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be applying your model to the text from the Federalist Papers.  The Federalist papers were a series of essay written in 1787 and 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay (they were published anonymously at the time), that promoted the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.  If you're curious, you can read more about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers). They are a particularly interesting data set, because although the authorship of most of the essays has been long known since around the deaths of Hamilton and Madison, there was still some question about the authorship of certain articles into the 20th century.  You'll use document vectors to do this analysis for yourself. Fundamental concepts like Dot product or [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) that you've been learning since grade 9 will be used here to predict the authorship of the Federalist papers. Awesome!"

    "First, implement the `__init__()` function in the `LanguageModel` class.  You can store the information any way you want, but we did this by building a two-level dictionary (in fact, we used the `collections.defaultdict` class, but this only make a few things a little bit shorter ... you are free to use it or not) `self.counts`, where the first key refers to the previous $n-1$ tokens, and the second key refers to the $n$th token, and the value simply stores the count of the number of times this combination was seen.  For ease of use in later function, we also created a `self.count_sums`, which contained the number of total times each $n-1$ combination was seen. We also build a `self.dictionary` variable, which is just a `set` object containing all the unique words in across the entire set of input document."
